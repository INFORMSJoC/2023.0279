Dear user:

The archive "SalomeforWindows.zip" contains MS WINDOWS executables of SALOME, a procedure for solving the simple assembly line balancing problem (SALBP).

For descriptions of SALOME and SALBP see (partially available at www.assembly-line-balancing.de):
Scholl, A. and R. Klein (1997): SALOME: A bidirectional branch and bound procedure for assembly line balancing. INFORMS Journal on Computing 9, pp. 319-334.

Scholl, A. and C. Becker (2003): State-of-the-art exact and heuristic solution procedures for simple assembly line balancing. To appear in: European Journal of Operational Research.

Contained are codes for three versions of SALBP:
SAL1for1.exe:  solves SALBP-1
SAL1for2.exe:  solves SALBP-2 (by iterative search procedures based on SALBP-1)
SAL1forE.exe:  solves SALBP-E (by iterative search procedures based on SALBP-1)

Data sets:
The archive "albdata.zip" contains standard benchmark data as described at "www.assembly-line-balancing.de" and in the literature given above. 

Construction of data files:
In order to solve other problem instances please construct data files in the same manner as given in "albdata.zip". Each file (extension ".in2") is constructed as follows: 
The first line solely contains the number n of tasks.
Each of the next n lines contains the task times t[i] for i=1,...,n.
Each following line contains one precedence relation in the formatting i,j (from-tasks and to-task separated by a colon).
As terminal mark use "-1,-1" (without the quotation marks).
Please notice that the tasks must be already numbered topologically, i.e. for each precedence relation i->j the condition i<j must hold.

Installation of the software:
Please unzip all program and batch files from "SalomeforWindows.zip" into a new directory. 
In order not to manipulate the batch files unzip the test data into the folder "c:\forschung\alb\daten\". 
If you decide to use another folder, please change the batch files accordingly.

Running the software:
The SALOME codes are executed by starting the batch files in a DOS window or by double clicking at the batch files in the WINDOWS explorer.
Alternatively, you may start SALOME for a single problem instance by providing the runtime parameters as specified in the batch files.
SAL1for1.exe and SAL1for2.exe:
Parameter 1: path and name of instance
Parameter 2: given problem parameter (cycle time for SALBP-1, number of stations for SALBP-2)
Parameter 3: time limit in seconds
SAL1forE.exe:
Parameter 1: path and name of instance
Parameter 2+3: minimal and maximal cycle time (if not restricted: 0 0)
Parameter 4+5: minimal and maximal number of stations (if not restricted: 0 0)
Parameter 6: time limit in seconds

Output:
The codes produce output files containing a single row for each instance with the optimal solution value (or an interval of remaining values in case of a time out) and the computation time (german style with a colon indicating floating point values). The last columns contain the task assignments (index of the stations to which the tasks i=1,...,n are assigned to).
